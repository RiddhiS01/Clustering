# Clustering
Comprehending the dynamic relationship between health indices and economic elements in diverse places can provide policymakers with crucial perspectives for optimising resource allocation and executing focused interventions. Our goal in doing this study is to investigate how health and economic situations relate to one another across different states in a nation. By grouping states according to economic and health metrics, we aim to find unique clusters of areas with related features. These clusters can then be used as a foundation for customising policy actions to deal with the unique requirements and difficulties that various regions encounter.
Goals of the Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting a comprehensive exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution, characteristics, and interrelationships among various variables. • Univariate Analysis • Multivariate Analysis

Performing hierarchical clustering: Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis that builds a hierarchy of clusters. We'll use dendrograms to identify the optimal number of clusters.

Performing K-Means Clustering: We will apply K-Means clustering in the next step and identify with the help of Elbow curve and Silhouette score the optimum number of clusters. Then we will train our model to identify all the cluster profiles and further present our findings

Describe cluster profiles and provide policy recommendations: Analyse the characteristics of each cluster to understand the unique combination of health and economic factors that define them. After that we will use insights from the analysis to provide actionable recommendations for policymakers, tailored to the specific needs and challenges of each cluster of states.
